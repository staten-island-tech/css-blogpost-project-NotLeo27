        <h4 class="maintext">Here, we have Kashimo, "the strongest of Edo Period".
          He just hunted farmers fr and beat up a gambler. 
          You guys remember when we thought that he would cook against the King of Curses? 
          Look at him now. Not even one chapter and he got diced like an onion and sauteed.<br>
          Even crazier, he really has only one fight that he was even with, and that was the gambler, which I mentioned earlier.</h3>
